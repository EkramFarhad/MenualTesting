‘≠≠≠Significance of testing 


Type of testing -- 

Manual VS automation

Class 1 - Manual Testing
		-- 

bugs - tickets - issues - defects

Where to test 
		browser
		mac / windows / linux
		

Login functionality -
	 						valid login
							invalid login
							blank login


Business/client explains the requirement
PO/BA prepares the document - SRS software requirement specification.

Application/software 
 -- AUT - application under test
 -- SUT - software under test
	
SRS - software requirement specification - covers the scope of application's functionality


Test plan document - a guide to QA team, what to test etc.
Test cases - splitting the user story into smaller parts - every part will be your test case


one functionality from multiple functionalities of software/AUT is called user story
User story -  login/ logout/ shopping/ prime video/ checkout

user story - login - 
Test cases -1.valid login
			  steps - 
					i.launch browser and application
					ii. enter username and password
					iii. click login button
					iv. verify the homepage
			2. invalid login
			3. blank login


3 types of application -

Web - application hosted over the internet browser called website/web application
Desktop - standalone application - MS word, calculator etc
Mobile - 


STLC - software testing life cycle

requirement analysis - to analyze the feasibility of the requirement
Test planning - test plan document is the output of it
Test case development - output is test cases developed
Environment setup - url uniform resource locator https://www.google.com/, dedicated devices, you need access
Test execution - after executing the test cases manually, we collect the results - actual vs expected
Test cycle closure -


Test planning - it gives you the direction and instructions of testing
Test case development - we write details of carrying out a testing - use user story and split it into smaller peices



Class 2 -
Recap - 
     STLC - software testing lifecycle


Test case development - 

User story -
Login functionality

TC1 - valid login
TC2 - invalid login
TC3 - blank login - username blank pass filled, pass blank username filled


why?

Pre requisite/ pre condition

before actually executing the test case, things need to be done
for example - to perform login test, precondition is - open browser


Developers are working - develop the application
QA is working - test the application


environment

developers work in their environment
Qa works in their environment

Dev environment
server where all the dev code is available where devloper works
www.amazondev.com

QA/Testing/Test
server where qa team works and test the application, it is the replica of dev environment
this is the place where functional testing is done
www.amazontest.com

but we have some other testing as well apart from functional
end to end testing

Staging environment - system testing is done
www.amazonstage.com
UAT - user acceptance testing


production/go live/live
www.amazon.com

Dev
QA/Test
Staging
Production



BUG - unexpected functionality of the application

bug/defect/issue/ticket/error



Class 3 -
Recap - environment setup 

dev server - only developer works
QA/Test env/server - QA team works - it is replica of dev, here we perform functional testing
Staging server/env - where we perform system testing and UAT testing
Production server/env - go live for customers


whenever we find a bug
	- reproduce the bug atleast 3 times
	- read the requirement again to make sure the bug you found is actually a bug
	- report the bug - 
		how do you report it?
		provide exact steps we took to reproduce the bug
		browser, time, environment, test data, screenshot or screen recording


status of the bug
open - when QA assign the bug to dev first time
fixed - when dev fix it and assign it back to the QA
closed - when QA test it again and satisfied with it
Re-opened - when QA test it again and not satisfied with it
Duplicate - when other QA member has already raised the bug
Deferred -  Dev accept it is a bug, but will decide to fix it later

Priority and Severity -

priority categories -
show stopper
major 
minor
cosmetics

High priority - High severity - login functionality of the application
High priority - Low severity - misspelled bank name on the home page
High Severity & Low Priority - When bug can wait for sometime to fix it
Low Priority and Low Severity - cosmetic bug 


BDD behavioral-driven development - 
it allows us to write the test cases/scenarios in plain english text - gherkin language

Gherkin tags -

Given - precondition
When - Performing actions
Then - Expected results
And - supporting tag (Can be used with given, when, then)
But - to exclude something (we don't use)

Given user is able to open chrome browser
When user enters username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user should be able to logged in

Cucumber scenarios -
it is written in a syntax/language/formula called gherkin. it is plain english text

BDD is used to define business requirements
and it encourages to write scenarios from user point of view

Scenario - 
Given user is able to open the amazon.com application
When user clicks on sign in button
And user enters email id
And user clicks on continue button
And user enters password
Then user should navigate to homepage

Acceptance criteria -
As an amazon user, user should be able to logged in


THE MAIN GOAL OF WRITING BDD SCENARIOS IS TO MAKE THE SCENARIO SENSE



HOMEWORK -
Write 5 cucumber - BDD scenarios along with acceptance criteria of your choice and submit them by Saturday

Given user is able to open the HRMS application
When user enters username
And user enters password
And user clicks on login button
Then user should navigate to homepage
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on add employee option
And user enters firstname and lastname
And user clicks on save button
Then employee added successfully

Acceptance criteria - user should be able to add employee

Types of testing -	

functional testing - 
non-functional testing - 

in QA/Test environment, functional testing


unit testing - it is done by the developer, we also call it component testing
integration testing - it is done by QA team
system testing / UAT testing -  system testing is done in staging environment and business user comes to test application in it
to perform UAT
